# themis-test - scripts for recreating results from themis paper

GTDB_206273_genomes_info.txt and RefDB_13404_genomes_info.txt contain the genome-level metadata for the two reference databases used in this study.
The scripts benchmark_NGS.sh and benchmark_long.sh provide the full benchmarking pipelines, including the exact commands, parameters and software settings used for the short-read and long-read experiments, respectively.
